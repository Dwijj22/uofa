# What: DS(DataStructure is method of storing and retriving data)
# Types: 1. Lenear 2. Non Lenear
# 1. Linear
""" 
    1. Arrays       : Seqential store of data with index
    2. Linked Lists : Stores data and also previous element link
    3. Stack        : Stores data in stack and retrive LIFO(Last in First Out)
    4. Queues       : Stores data in queue and retrive FIFO(First in First Out)
    5. Matrix       : Two dimentional data storage and they are retrivied using matrix index

# 2. Non Linear
    1. Tree         : Data stored in nodes and parent node can only have two child nodes
    2. Graph        ; Data stored in nodes and connect by links
    3. Heap         : Data stored in nodes, where parent and child node values will be ascending or descending all thru
    4. Hash Table   : Associative Arrays
    
# 3. Python Special Datastructures
    1. List         ; Similar to Array but can have hetrogenous data types
    2. Tuples       : Similar to List but immutable
    3. Dictionary   : Similar to List but data stored in Key and Values
